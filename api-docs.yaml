  title: Election API
  description: |
    This API provides tools that let user manage users, posts, comments, and votes. With this API, selected candidates who have been promoted by the admin can create posts and manage them. Users can view and comment on their perceptions of candidates' posts using comments. Admin can create and start an election by specifying the election name, start date, and end date. On election day, users will be able to cast their votes and see the live count.
    
    To use this API you need to obtain a JWT Token by logging in and entering it on the authorization button below. For development purposes, you are allowed to use our predefined user data with admin privileges. You can use 'admin' as the username and 'root' as the password when logging in. Alternatively, you can register as a new user with your own credentials.

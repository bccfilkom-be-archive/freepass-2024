## **👪** Entities and Actors

We want to see your perspective about these problems. You can define various types of entities or actors. One thing for sure, there is no
true or false statement to define the entities. As long as the results are understandable, then go for it! 🚀
```
Entities!!!
1. Users:
-id
-username
-email
-password
-role -> there are only 3 role ADMIN/CANDIDDATE/USER
-created_at
-updated_at

2. Posts:
-id
-user_id
-post
-created_at
-updated_at

3. Comments:
-id
-user_id
-post_id
-comment
-created_at

4. Election_times:
-id
-start_time
-end_time

5. Votes:
-user_id
-choice
-vote_time

Actorss!!!
User: a role that allow yoo to vote a candidate. A user can see candidate posts and comment on the post
Candidate: a role that will be voted. A candidate can create a post, edit a post and delete it too.
Admin: a role that regulates the course of election. Admin can set the start time and end time for election, promote user to candidate, and others
```
